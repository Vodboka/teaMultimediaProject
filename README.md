 # Geo-Tagged Photo Gallery 
 Develop a photo gallery where images are displayed on a map based on where they were taken


 A few considerations on the development of the project:

1. The projects must contain at least 2 of the following APIs. Canvas API is mandatory. Our project contains Canvas API and Geolocation API
2. Adding Bootstrap to your project is mandatory
3. You are not allowed to use any external libraries apart from Bootstrap, jQuery and $Leaflet (for projects involving a map).
4. All JavaScript code must be provided in a single .js file (see scripts directory)
5. Include in your archive all the required assets (images, json files etc.) 
6.  Use ONLY relative paths to reference resources
